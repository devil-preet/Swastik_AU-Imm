                    <p>As the name indicates, this stream permits employers to directly nominate their workers for permanent residence without negotiating a labor agreement.</p>

                    <h2>Two stages to Direct Entry Process:</h2>

                    ♦ Employer will first lodge a nomination application indicating the position and the person they are nominating.<br>
                    ♦ Then, Employer lodges a visa application. Both the nomination and visa application can be lodged on the same day, but consideration will be given to nomination first, and its approval is required before the approval of the visa application.

                    <h2>This visa permits you:</h2>

                    ♦ Stay permanently in Australia.<br>
                    ♦ Study or work in Australia.<br>
                    ♦ Enroll for Medicare (Australia’s public healthcare scheme).<br>
                    ♦ Sponsor your relatives to come to Australia.<br>

In case you want to travel after the initial 5 years' travel facility, you will have to apply for and be granted a Resident-Return (RRV) to re-enter Australia as a permanent resident. If you become an Australian citizen then you don’t require a visa to enter Australia and can use it to travel to and from Australia. If you leave Australia after the travel facility date has expired, without having another permanent visa with having a valid travel facility, for instance, a RRV, you might not be able to return to Australia as a Permanent Resident.<br>
                    ♦ Apply for citizenship (if eligible).<br>
                    ♦ Newly arrived residents may have to wait to access benefits of Australian Government.

                    <h2>Duration of Stay:</h2>

                    ♦ As it is a permanent visa, you can stay for an indefinite time.<br>
                    ♦ Your permanent residence starts on the day of the grant of the visa.
