                    <h2>HOW TO GET ADMISSION IN AUSTRALIA?</h2>

                    <p>Admission in Australia is a five-step comprehensive process that integrates the following procedure:</p>

                    <p>♦ Research and Choose Your Course and Institution</p>
                    <p>1. Decide on the course you want to study and research various institutions offering it.</p>
                    <p>2. Consider factors like specialization, location, campus facilities, and support services for international students.</p>
                    <p>3. Consider your financial situation when selecting an institution.</p>

                    <p>♦ Apply to Your Chosen Institution</p>
                    <p>1. Submit an inquiry or application through the institution’s website.</p>
                    <p>2. Check and ensure you meet the academic and English language requirements.</p>
                    <p>3. Keep track of application deadlines to avoid missing them.</p>

                    <p>♦ Wait for Application Processing</p>
                    <p>1. Your application will be processed, and you’ll receive a notification of the outcome.</p>
                    <p>2. Some applications, particularly for postgraduate courses, may take longer to process.</p>

                    <p>♦ Receive and Review Offer Letter</p>
                    <p>1. If your application is successful, you’ll receive an offer letter and acceptance form.</p>
                    <p>2. Review the terms and conditions outlined in the offer letter carefully.</p>
                    <p>3. Fulfill any conditions specified before receiving a Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE), which may include paying tuition fees.</p>

                    <p>♦ Prepare for Departure and Apply for Student Visa</p>
                    <p>1. Once you’ve accepted the offer, start preparing for your journey to Australia.</p>
                    <p>2. Apply for a student visa using either your offer letter or CoE.</p>
                    <p>3. Seek assistance from Visazz Group for any queries related to your visa or admission process.</p>

                    <h2>IS IT POSSIBLE TO STUDY IN AUSTRALIA WITHOUT IELTS OR TOEFL / BANK STATEMENT?</h2>

                    <p>A common question many people have is whether they can study in Australia without taking the IELTS or TOEFL or any other English exams. The answer is yes! Numerous educational institutions in Australia offer programs that don’t require these standard English proficiency tests.</p>

                    <p>Additionally, it’s worth noting that you can also study in Australia without providing a bank statement as part of the admission process.</p>

                    <h2>SOME INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT EDUCATION IN AUSTRALIA</h2>

                    <p>According to the most recent United Nations report, Australia continues to lead globally in education with an impressive Education Index score of 0.993.</p>

                    <p>As of the latest available statistics, Australia welcomed over 700,000 international students in its educational institutions, representing a diverse cohort from more than 190 countries around the world.</p>

                    <p>International students aiming to pursue education in Australia often seek courses registered under CRICOS (Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students). This registration ensures adherence to Australia’s stringent academic standards, providing assurance of quality education.</p>

                    <p>At Visazz Group, we provide access to up-to-date expert assistance and top-quality advice to facilitate a smooth educational journey.

                <section id="New CoE">
                    <h2 class="block-title">New CoE</h2>
                    <h1>Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) for Australia</h1>

                    <p>The Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) is an important document that proves you are allowed to go to an Australian university or college. It is given to you after you accept the institution’s offer letter, which confirms that you want the offered spot.</p>

                    <p>The CoE is an important part of the process of getting a student visa to study in Australia. Inside the CoE, you can find a lot of information about yourself, like what program you are in, how much it will cost, and how long you will be studying.</p>

                    <h2>How long does it take to get a Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE)?</h2>

                    <p>After you finish the steps below, you will receive the official Confirmation of Enrolment (COE).</p>

                    ♦ Acceptance of Offer: Once your application to study has been accepted, you have officially agreed to take the program offered by the university.<br>
                    ♦ Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC): Paying the fee for Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC) for the length of time you want your visa to remain valid for.<br>
                    ♦ Payment for Tuition: Once you’ve paid the tuition costs or the initial deposit that was mentioned in your offer letter.<br>

                    <p>Once you have the CoE, you can use your Immi account to apply for a student visa. The CoE is a very important document that the Department of Home Affairs needs to process visa applications.</p>

                    <h2>What should you do if your Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) is canceled?</h2>

                    <p>If the International Student Support office of the university or college cancels your CoE, they will inform you via email. Soon after getting the notice, you have 28 days to do one of these things:</p>

                    ♦ Leave Australia: Within the time limit given, you can choose to leave Australia.<br>
                    ♦ Apply for a different visa: If you meet the requirements for a different type of visa, you can also apply for a different visa.<br>
                    ♦ Apply to have your CoE reinstated: You have 28 days to apply to the university if you think there are good reasons to have your CoE reinstated. You can also arrange a new CoE from another university or college of the same AQF level. Visazz Group can help you with this thing, you can approach for assistance.<br>

                    <p>The Department of Home Affairs can cancel your student visa at any time after the 28-day period is over.</p>

                    <h2>What are some circumstances in which your CoE can be canceled?</h2>

                    <p>The University may cancel your CoE for several reasons. For example:</p>

                    ♦ Failed to enroll in the course.<br>
                    ♦ Failed to pay your tuition fees.<br>
                    ♦ Been precluded from further study under the University’s Unsatisfactory Academic Progress policy.<br>
                    ♦ Decided to defer your studies to a later date.<br>
                    ♦ Decided to withdraw from my studies at the University.<br>
                    ♦ Decided to transfer to a different education provider.<br>
                    ♦ Completed your studies early.<br>

                    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>

                    <h3>Question: What does the CoE include?</h3>

                    <p>Answer: The COE has important information about you, like your name, the course or program you are taking, when you start and end your studies, and information about the institution of study.</p>

                    <h3>Question: Can I apply for an Australian student visa without a CoE?</h3>

                    <p>Answer: No, you can’t. You must include evidence of enrollment in study with your student visa application, or your application will not be valid and can’t be processed.</p>

                    <p><strong>Applying outside Australia:</strong> You must provide a Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) for each course of study with your visa application.</p>
                    <p><strong>Applying inside Australia:</strong> You can provide a CoE or Letter of Offer for all intended courses. But you must provide your CoE before the Department of Home Affairs can grant your visa.</p>

                    <h3>Question: For how much time is a CoE valid?</h3>

                    <p>Answer: The validity of a CoE is determined by the duration of your course or program. It usually lasts the duration of your studies, including any breaks or holidays.</p>

                    <h3>Question: In what circumstances can I apply for a student visa without a CoE?</h3>

                    <p>Answer: You do not need to provide a Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) if you are:</p>

                    ♦ Enrolled in a full-time course of study or training under a scholarship scheme approved by the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade: you must provide a letter of support.<br>
                    ♦ Sponsored by the Australian Department of Defence: you must provide a letter of support.<br>
                    ♦ A secondary exchange student: provide an Acceptance Advice of Secondary Exchange Student (AASES) form.<br>

                    <h2>HOW TO CHANGE COURSE IN AUSTRALIA?</h2>

                    <p>We wonder that can international students change courses in Australia. The process of the course change/transfer is a comprehensive one, have a look below:</p>

                    1. In case you make up your mind to change of course in Australia but you have not completed six months of your principal course, then under ESOS National Code, such circumstances are explained. Unless special conditions apply, you need to have permission from your existing institution to transfer to another institution. The institution must assess or consider your request to transfer. All the educational institutions in Australia have documented procedures for their transfer policy. Make sure you understand your education provider’s transfer policy and what your written agreement says before you attempt to enroll with a new institution.

                    2. In case, your institution does not give you permission to transfer to another course/institution in Australia and you are not satisfied with the outcome, you should first use your education provider’s internal appeal process. If you are not satisfied still, you can then appeal against the institution’s decision at external complaints handling body such as the State or Territory Ombudsman or the Overseas Student Ombudsman. Remember, if you change your institution or course at any time you must contact the Department of Home Affairs, Australia, and provide an electronic Confirmation of Enrolment (eCoE) certificate from your new institution.

                    3. Once your transfer application is granted, you must check your student visa requirements and ensure you follow the correct procedures to maintain your visa. It is very vital that you do not assume that the advice you get from friends, fellow students, or education agents is correct. Make sure to keep a copy of any course cancellation and enrolment paperwork.

                    4. You also need to consider visiting the Department of Home Affairs, Australia as there will be changes in your visa. In order to remain updated and abiding by the law, do visit the department or contact immigration consultancies like Visazz Group.

                    <h2 class="block-title">What is Recognized Prior Learning (RPL), Australia?</h2>
                    <p>An assessment process, Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) is used by RTOs to evaluate a person’s skills, knowledge, and experience gained through working and learning. It is through RPL where you can get your work experience and skills assessed so that you can obtain a credible qualification through it. The qualification you gain is based on the skills you learn on the worksite and not the one in the classroom. It makes obtaining your qualification quicker and cheaper. It is cheaper as compared to a full qualification because you’re not paying to learn things you already know.</p>

                    <p>For instance, if you have worked as a nursing staff for many years, you might already be aware of the skills and knowledge that you would require if you studied the course in Australia. It is through RPL in Australia where you can turn the skills and knowledge you have gained by working in the field.</p>

                    <p>If you are applying for RPL of the programming units at the Diploma level, Visazz Group offer much-needed assistance as to how to convince them about your true intention to study in Australia.</p>

                    <h2>What are the requirements for RPL?</h2>

                    <p>The primary work requirement for an RPL in Australia incorporates a process where you need to be currently employed in a position that allows you to demonstrate the skills required for the unit and/or qualification. For instance, if you are applying for RPL of the programming units at the Diploma level, you will need to hold a position where you are accountable for planning and implementing the curriculum. This would enable the assessors to see you fulfilling the necessities of the unit to assess your competency. In addition to this, you will also need a supervisor in that workplace willing to sign you off on the competencies required.</p>

                    <h2>How much does RPL in Australia cost?</h2>

                    <p>Recognized Prior Learning in Australia comes at a cost that varies depending on a lot of factors including:</p>

                    ♦ the place of assessment<br>
                    ♦ the qualification you are looking to obtain<br>
                    ♦ the amount of work that goes into each assessment<br>
                    ♦ previous work experience<br>

                    <p>In case, your qualification is financed by the Government of Australia there will be no additional cost for the RPL process. But, if you are a self-financed student and you have enrolled as a Fee-For-Service student, the cost for RPL in Australia starts from $160 per unit and varies with the institute.</p>

                    <h2>How do I apply for RPL in Australia?</h2>

                    <p>In order to make an initial assessment for RPL, you need to have the following documents:</p>

                    ♦ Job description<br>
                    ♦ A recent resume comprising your work history, skills, and knowledge<br>
                    ♦ Transcripts of qualifications that you have completed<br>
                    ♦ Any professional development or training you have attended<br>

                    <p>Note that this would be an initial assessment only. The number of units for RPL may increase or decrease throughout the RPL process depending on your prior skills and knowledge.</p>

                <section id="Request to Defer Your Studies">
                    <h2 class="block-title">Request to Defer Your Studies</h2>
                    <p>Are you the one who received an offer of completing your studies from an Australian Institute, yet right now, you are not ready to dive into study? Then, this Visazz Group guide is for you on how to defer your course.</p>

                    <p>Depending on your course, you may have the option to defer your offer for up to one year. This means that the university will hold a place for you to enroll in your course the following semester or year. Deferment is open to most of the students including coursework or research, domestic or international students. International students on a student visa can only defer subjects in accordance with the conditions outlined in the National Code.</p>

                    <h2>WHY DO STUDENTS CONSIDER DEFERRING OF STUDIES</h2>

                    <p>There might be various reasons as to why students would request to defer studies in Australia. The following are some common ones:</p>

                    <br>♦ Taking time off to travel, work or volunteer abroad can be a reason to defer your studies. This will allow you to think about where you want to go in life.

                    <br>♦ Taking a gap year to explore other cultures can make a big difference in your personal development and future employment prospects.

                    <br>♦ To boost your grades you might want to consider taking a break. A study by the Sydney School of Education and Social Work in 2013 showed that students who took a gap for a year achieved higher marks at university than students who entered straight after school.

                    <br>♦ To earn some cash, students consider a request to defer studies so that they can build up a savings account is a great way to ensure financial stress won’t impact your studies once you get here.

                    <h2>COST</h2>

                    <p>Some education providers may ask for a deferral fee which might be ranging from AUD 100-AUD 200, which might be refundable or non-refundable.</p>

                    <h2>PROCESS</h2>

                    <p>You can request a deferral through Visazz Group during the process of accepting your offer.</p>

                    <p>You will receive the outcome of your request through email. We will notify you in the following situations:</p>

                    - if your deferral application is accepted and approved, a new offer will be issued
                    - if your application to defer is rejected. In this case, you can still accept your offer by following the instructions provided with your outcome response
                    - if you wish to delay the start of your course for longer than a year, you will need to reapply to the university to which you got admission previously.

                    <p>If you’re an international student who has already accepted the offer and also you have paid your tuition fees, you can still apply to defer if you have not applied for your student visa. If your application to defer is approved, the education provider might do not hold your place in the institution – but they would give you an offer for the following semester or year. A new electronic Confirmation of Enrolment (COE) will be issued when you accept the second offer.</p>
