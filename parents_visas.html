                            <h2 class="block-title">Contributory Aged Parent visa (subclass 864)</h2>
                            <p>This Permanent visa is for those elderly people whose most of the children have been living in Australia as an Australian citizen (settled)*, a permanent resident of Australia or a New Zealand (eligible) citizen to stay temporarily in Australia.</p>

                            <h2>Overview</h2>

                            <p>This Partner Visa allows the de facto Partner or Spouse of an Australian citizen, Permanent Resident of Australia or an eligible citizen of New Zealand to migrate to Australia Permanently.</p>

                            <p>*” Settled” means a person who must have been living in Australia for usually 2 years (for a reasonable period).</p>

                            <h2>Purpose</h2>
